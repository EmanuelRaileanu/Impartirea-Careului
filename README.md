This is a game I had to code for my "Introduction to Programming" class.

The idea is simple: You start with an nxn board with n pieces randomly positioned on the board.
The goal is to draw areas of n squares on the board such that at the end you have exactly one piece in each area.

There is also autocompletion available for a 8x8 board, just as a proof of concept. (click on the question mark in the top right corner of the board)
